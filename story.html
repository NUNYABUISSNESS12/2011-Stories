  <h1>Magic Isn't Real - Chapters 12 and Up</h1>

  <h2>Chapter 12: The Nintendo Ninja</h2>
  <p>I wish for an upgraded switch that plays any game called the ZackCube™ of Magic. I played Zelda, Mario, Animal Crossing, and more. That second, a black ninja came in and I got attacked.</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 12</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 13: The Neighbor</h2>
  <p>I was sleeping when I woke up and my football was gone. Seconds later, Zack called and he said to stop wishing for cookies. I explained I didn't. Did they or someone steal it? I saw a trail of cookie crumbs. I followed them. I ended up with my neighbor—it was the cookie man.</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 13</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 14: Question The Neighbor</h2>
  <p>I questioned the neighbor. All DAN wanted was cookies. He returned the football, and I wished him unlimited cookies forever.</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 14</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 15: Peace For All</h2>
  <p>I wished peace for all, as it lays the groundwork for understanding and compassion. I wished that we could remove laws that unfairly label belief in magic as illegal, allowing everyone to embrace their unique perspectives without fear of persecution. And then it was all over. Everywhere had peace. Nowhere could be thrown away because of their beliefs.</p>
  <p><strong>THE END</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 16: Different Dimensions</h2>
  <p>It was a normal day for me. I had already solved world peace and thought there was nothing more for me to do. Suddenly, Zack rang my doorbell. I opened the door and said, “Hey Zack.” Zack replied, “Hey, I need to talk to you… can I come in?” I replied, “Sure, I'm not doing anything right now.”</p>
  <p>Zack came in and said, “Hey, so I wanted you to know…” Bentley discovers that the magic football can transport him to different dimensions or time periods. The Cookie Man then came over, and I quickly said “Magic VANISH.” All of a sudden the magic disappeared. The Cookie Man, Dan, who is my neighbor and loves cookies, said he went bankrupt and no longer owned a farm. I replied, “Wait what? Uhm, I'm a bit busy—I’ll send you money in a bit.” I then transferred $10,000,000 to CookieMan.</p>
  <p>I made a portal to a cookie dimension and gave it to the neighborhood. I told him to be careful as it might be dangerous. I also made a portal with video games—it had PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and more. I thought, why don't I change the date to Fall of 2025 when GTA 6 will be released? I clicked one of the portals, plugged in the keyboard, and typed 9/00/25. Then it was GTA 6 time. I clicked TIME TRAVEL, downloaded the game on PC, PS5, and all consoles onto a green USB, and went back and played GTA 6.</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 16</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 17: The Space Quest</h2>
  <p>I was going to wish for a giant pool of cheese. Suddenly, Zack called. He said, “There was a shortage of magic.” I replied, “What do you mean a shortage of magic?” He said, “Well, my friend, try using the football.”</p>
  <p>I put down the phone real quick and said, “I wish for $1,000,000,000.” Nothing happened. I picked up the phone again. I said, “How do we get it back?” Zack replied, “We’ll have to wait. There’s no guarantee.” I replied again, “WHAT DO YOU MEAN?” Zack said on the phone, “Someone is using a magic block somewhere in space.”</p>
  <p>I said, “SPACE?” Zack replied, “Yes, I think so.” I told him, “We need to meet IRL (in real life).” Zack hangs up and uses his teleport wand. “How did you get here with magic? I thought we were out?” Zack said, “My wand has only a little bit of magic left.”</p>
  <p>I told Zack, “We need a spaceship and gear. Can you do it?” I saw a sparkly wand that Zack held and said, “Upon us the enchanted gear” into the mic. At that second, the doorbell rang. It was a NASA agent with the gear. He said, “Buddy, I'm from NASA. Don’t break the equipment or you won’t get your deposit back.”</p>
  <p>As we went to space, Zack coached me on the screen on what to do: “Okay, click Start, then set the cords to S,U,P Satellite.” I headed there. I saw a glowing satellite with a device called "blocker" and the signal was damaged. I repaired it, and all magic was restored. Zack confirmed it.</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 17</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 18: Magic No Longer</h2>
  <p>It was a normal day. I turned on the TV, and suddenly the TV said “BREAKING NEWS.” I saw the mayor at the White House. He wanted the whole town to meet at 207 N Main St. I said, “I wish I was at 207 N Main St.” I saw the mayor. He declared magic is now illegal and that believing in magic was illegal again.</p>
  <p>I then got in my car and drove back to my home, 3955 N Chadbourne St, and then I wished…</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 18</strong></p>

  <h2>Chapter 19: The Wish</h2>
  <p>I wished, “I wish I was the president.” The football replied, “I’m sorry, Master…” I replied, “What do you mean?” I called Zack. I dialed 555-ZACK. He said, “Hey, I’m sorry. You can’t wish for such things. You would need to get voted next election.”</p>
  <p>THE PHONE ENDS. I then waited till the next election. It looked like it was Trump and Harris. I then entered the voting race and said in an ad campaign: “Vote for ME. I will...”</p>
  <p><strong>END OF 19</strong></p>
